summary: 'Hi I am Richard Tirtadji,
A simple guy who happen to love technology. Ever since my early career I have been drawn toward new tech. I love playing with gadget such as camera, mobile device, IoT, electronics device and off course love to code. The only other hobby that does not include technology is CAR. I love modifiying car from engine, suspension, and bodykit.'
